## Tech used

- React
- react-media-recorder v 1.4.0
- MUI material for styling

## Documentation:

- Focused on the audio recording as most feasible within time limit.
- Considered MongoDB vs firebase, decided firebase makes more sense for simpler storage.
- Due to the need to more custom manipulation, using Express.js would make sense.

## Notes

- How is audio correcting possible? My imessage can barely transcribe what I send in voice messages.
